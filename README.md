# Multifactorial immune response

### Setup

#### Dependencies
The methods and experiments are written in Python 3. We recommend using Conda to manage dependencies. The `environment.yml` file includes the dependencies, which you can install with:

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    source activate multifactorial-immune-response-env

#### Data
Run `snakemake all` to download and process datasets used in our experiments.
